# Yet Another Unnamed Game
Something for me to practise my rust skills. Once I get a better idea of what this will be, repo will be renamed accordingly.

### What I plan to practice
- Async handlers
- Database migrations (sqlx)
- TDD & mocking
- Domain
- Redis sessions

Possibly the list will grow with time, for now this will be more than enough to get started. I will use `semantic` versioning, starting with version `0.0.1`

PS: If you have any suggestions to my code, please feel free to let me know or create a PR, I am learning after all.
